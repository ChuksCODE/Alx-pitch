## Project Overview
This is a pitch I made, as a team lead during my foundations training with ALX Africa seeking funding and support to bring our envisioned web application solution to life. The research Problem was centred on the limited availability of educational resources in Nigerian Universities, making educational resources not accessible particularly for the self-funded Nigerian students.
My team proposed a tech soluion (Edflex), a web app that is easy to navigate and contains educational resources and creates room for peer-peer learning and student-tutor interactive session. It features deadlines for assignments, courses, classroom activities, community and student profile.
